# jenkinsdiagrams

This script converts a folder of Jenkins files into a visual representation.

Whilst there are [Jenkins plugins to view pipeline graphs](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/), you have to
enter a pipeline first.
If you have many pipelines and don't know the top-level/entrypoint pipelines, you might like this tool.
Visualise in the terminal, as textual diagrams, or render with your IDE/GitHub/Docusaurus etc.

# Inputs

Specify a path to your project.
`Jenkinsfile.*` and any files ending with `.jenkinsfile` will be scanned

# Options

With `.jenkinsfile`s, the file isn't enough to state whether they are used as a top-level pipeline in Jenkins (vs being
called by a higher-level pipeline).

To create a more accurate visual representation of your pipelines, add this line to the top of your Jenkins files which
are called directly from the Jenkins UI:

```groovy
// jenkins2diagram:toplevel
```

# Supported outputs

Here's a few options - I'm considering:

- Mermaid diagram
    - Renders in GitHub .md previews
    - Renders in Docusaurus (a static website tool)
- ~Ascii art~
    - Renders anywhere
- ~Image files~

I'll focus on mermaid first.
I think the app will return text to stdout, which can be piped `>` by the user into a file if they wish.

# Developing a POC (1/2)

This app is quite domain / keyword specific, so for this POC I aim to:

- [x] Get the basic file reading, pipeline mappings, etc. correct with simplified syntax:

```
# Jenkinsfile 
// jenkins2diagram:toplevel
build job: 'a'
build job: 'b'

// a.jenkinsfile

// b.jenkinsfile
build job: 'c'

// c.jenkinsfile
```

Should produce:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Z[Jenkinsfile]
    Z[Jenkinsfile] --> A[a]
    Z[Jenkinsfile] --> B[b]
    B[b] --> C[c]
```

## Notes on GraphViz DOT and Mermaid

Note: To kickstart generating the tree, I used [anytree](https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree).
It can export to a Python dictionary, JSON, or "Dot" format.
The DOT language is a grammar for [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html).

- IntelliJ
    - recognised Mermaid in my code block, offered to install the plugin, and rendered correctly. Mermaid plays
      nice with GitHub and Docusaurus, as is already mentioned
    - making graph.dot let the IDE suggest a plugin install. A sample graph renders nicely, and copy to clipboard/save
      to file work great
- GitHub markdown rendering
    - [Including graphviz graphs is a little indirect](https://github.com/TLmaK0/gravizo) (some html tags and custom
      marks seem to be necessary)
        -
      Apparently [Graphviz is in C, and Mermaid is written in JS](https://forum.graphviz.org/t/github-adding-support-for-mermaid-diagrams/998)
        - and mermaid is a little prettier
- Docusaurus
    - I only see documentation on Mermaid support - nothing for Graphviz
- Converting Graphviz DOT to Mermaid
    - Kroki: A server that renders a bunch of different textual diagrams to images

Overall, I should probably aim to add a Mermaid exporter to `anytree`. There's no issues/PRs for it so far.
`anytree`'s `dotexporter.py` is ~ 400 lines, but more than half of it is examples.
I'll try a basic version in this POC first.

The mermaid tree generation is working nicely.
Seeing that anytree can import/export trees as Python dictionaries helped me see I can move to a minimal dependency
version, hopefully without too much challenge. That can happen later.
I will try to raise a basic PR for a Mermaid exporter now.
https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree/pull/215 is the basic PR, with nice diagrams in the description!

# Developing a POC (2/3)

- [x] Change to support more proper syntax
    - It seems about right for now
- [x] Be more flexible with matches (`build(job: '...',...)` vs `build job:'...'`, etc.))
    - Writing some unit tests for this

# Developing a POC (3/3)

## Create a CLI

As a user, I would like to:

- (Option) `--path PATH` to scan.
    - Default: current directory.
    - Example: `jenkisdiagram --path ~/IdeaProjects/monorepo`.
- (Option) `--folders NAME` to scan, in addition to root.
    - Default: all folders.
        - If it's too slow for large repositories, can change default to scan only root and `pipelines`.
    - Example: `jenkinsdiagram --folders infra/jenkins/pipelines-old --folders infra/jenkins/pipelines-new`

[Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) is awesome

Calling the app with `--help` will list the (all optional) arguments:

```shell
python .\main.py --help
```

Optional args, exceptions, etc. are all nicely formatted.

Arg parsing is done and the CLI feels nice. I want to publish to homebrew before 

# Pushing to HomeBrew

[Packaging a Python CLI tool for Homebrew](https://til.simonwillison.net/homebrew/packaging-python-cli-for-homebrew)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

PyPi publish first, then brew!
https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-setup-py.html

python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/*
Okay, that has published https://pypi.org/project/jenkinsdiagram/1.0.0/

it's just a .tar.gz of the repo :think:
Can't seem to make it run (as an app) from terminalm, ah well let's jump to trying homebrew

Now we can try the homebrew stuff
Simon Willison's guide is good
https://github.com/IdiosApps/homebrew-jenkinsdiagram install instructions
Install wanted GitHub login for some reason. Fresh PAT wasn't working, but `gh auth login` revalidate did the trick 

`brew list` shows jenkinsdiagram
but the command doesn't work, and neither does just `jenkinsdiagram`
install logs noted:
`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenkinsdiagram/1.0.0/libexec/bin/pip`

compare with
brew tap simonw/datasette
brew install simonw/datasette/datasette

/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenkinsdiagram/1.0.0 has no `bin`
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/datasette/0.64.1 has a `bin`

```
> /opt/homebrew/Cellar/datasette/0.64.1/bin/datasette --version
datasette, version 0.64.1
```

Probably in the distribution side of things, but let's compare the homebrew repos:
https://github.com/IdiosApps/homebrew-jenkinsdiagram/blob/main/Formula/jenkinsdiagram.rb
https://github.com/simonw/homebrew-datasette/blob/main/Formula/datasette.rb
Nothing crazy different

Let's compare one file we made to make a dist;
https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/setup.py
https://github.com/IdiosApps/jenkinsdiagram/blob/pypi-homebrew/setup.py

This looks interesting:
```
    entry_points="""
        [console_scripts]
        datasette=datasette.cli:cli
    """,
```

This looks like a reasonable thing to attempt!

Update setup.py with entry_point + version bump
sdist
push
pip install 
poet -f
bump brew repo url + hash
...
now we have `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenkinsdiagram/1.0.1/bin`!
Running it gives:
```
  File "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenkinsdiagram/1.0.1/libexec/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jenkinsdiagram/main.py", line 8, in <module>
    import app
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```
So we're getting closer, but still a bit more investigation to go.

need to declare imports in init?

may need a nice __.main__.py wrapping of the cli? https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/556. It seems fair:
```
➜ python -m datasette --version
python -m datasette, version 0.64.1
➜ datasette --version
datasette, version 0.64.1
```

Hmm, last couple commits had no impact - still get the same error, but at least I know I can get it in PyPi (earlier than brew)
`python -m jenkinsdiagram --version`
```
  File "......./jenkinsdiagram/jenkinsdiagram/cli.py", line 8, in <module>
    import app
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```

Test PyPi - we can push to an alternate repo to prevent cluttering the real PyPi project with bad dists
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-testpypi/
`twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
`python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package`

# Other nice things

- [x] CLI could output to SVG
    - https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
      - png and pdf work fine; svg needs some manual config setup (noted in CLI)
      - user installs with `npm i -g`
      - and it's an official repo from the mermaid team
    - ~~https://github.com/superj80820/mermaid-js-converter~~
      - sends out diagram to a URL
